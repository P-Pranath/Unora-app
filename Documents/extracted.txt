About\nUnora is a new way to build human connection-designed around consistency, anticipation, and growth, not speed or swipes.\nCore Concept\nUsers start \nanonymous\n, browse \nreal people via hobbies\n, \nmutually choose each other\n, build a \nshared streak for 15 days\n, unlock \nreal identity details every 3 days\n, and \nonly then\n are allowed to chat.\nThis is \nearned communication\n.\nUser Mental Model (VERY IMPORTANT)\nExample Flow (Guy ↔ Girl)\nGuy hobbies: \nGym, Hiking, Biking\nGirl hobbies: \nPainting, Cooking, Dancing\nDiscovery Logic\nGuy sees:\n “Anonymous profile — Loves painting”\nGirl sees:\n “Anonymous profile — Consistent gymmer”\nThey are \nnot matched by hobby\nThey are matched by \nmutual attraction to hobbies\nMatching System (Mutual Choice, Not Algorithm Only)\nStep 1 - Browse Anonymous Cards\nUsers browse \nanonymous profiles\n:\nHobby list\nConsistency score (AI-generated)\nTime commitment\nNo name / photo\nStep 2 — Express Interest\nGuy likes a painting profile\nGirl likes a gym profile\nStep 3 — Mutual Like → Lock Match\nOnly then:\n“You’ve found a streak partner.\n Stay consistent to unlock who they really are.”\nOnly \n1 active match at a time (free tier)\n.\n“We’re not trying to convert Tinder users.\nWe’re unlocking an audience that refuses to use Tinder.”\nA platform to build meaningful connections through shared commitment.\n“Dating apps have optimized the same swipe-and-chat model for a decade, but the underlying interaction design hasn’t fundamentally changed.”\nUnora - In‑Depth Product & Technical Architecture\nPositioning premise\n: Unora is not a dating app. It is a \ncommitment‑first connection system\n where consistency, safety, and anticipation precede communication.\n1. System Overview (End‑to‑End)\nUnora is composed of five tightly coupled layers:\nIdentity & Trust Layer\n – real‑person verification without public identity exposure\nDiscovery & Matching Layer\n – constrained choice + mutual intent\nStreak & Progression Engine\n – the core behavioral loop\nAI Mediation Layer\n – pacing, safety, framing, and scoring\nMonetization & Control Layer\n – ethical monetization via time, flexibility, and control\nEach layer is intentionally opinionated. Removing friction from any one layer breaks the system.\n2. Onboarding & Identity Verification (Non‑Negotiable)\n2.1 Profile Creation (Private, Complete)\nDuring onboarding, users provide \nfull personal details\n, even though most are hidden initially.\nCollected data (private by default):\nFull name\nDate of birth\nGender (self‑described, optional visibility)\nCity + locality\nEducation\nProfession\nReligion / cultural background (optional)\nPhotos (private until final reveal)\nPrinciple\n: \nPrivacy through delayed exposure, not through missing data.\n2.2 Legitimacy Verification (Hard Gate)\nUsers must verify identity \nbefore entering discovery\n.\nAccepted methods:\nGovernment‑backed digital identity via entity["organization","DigiLocker","india digital identity service"]\nAadhaar‑based verification (hash‑only storage, no raw ID retention)\nTechnical notes:\nVerification tokens stored, not documents\nAll PII encrypted at rest (AES‑256)\nZero visibility of verification method to other users\nWhy this matters\n:\nEliminates catfishing at the system level\nEnables delayed identity reveals safely\nBuilds women‑first trust without marketing it loudly\n3. Server Selection (Intent Segmentation)\nAfter verification, users choose \none intent server\n:\nLooking for a partner\nFriend / companion\nAccountability / growth buddy\nRules:\nOne active server at a time (Free & Plus)\nPro may switch servers with cooldown\nMatches never cross servers\nWhy servers matter\n:\nReduces expectation mismatch\nPrevents romantic pressure in non‑romantic contexts\nImproves AI matching accuracy\n4. Discovery & Card System\n4.1 Anonymous Cards (Main Screen)\nCards intentionally avoid identity signals.\nVisible on cards:\nHobby anchors with micro‑descriptions\nConsistency score (banded, not numeric)\nAvailability level\nPersonality cues (tri‑state selectors)\nNot visible:\nName\nFace\nSocial links\nExact profession\n4.3 Mutual Connection → Lock‑In\nUser A requests to connect\nUser B independently requests\nOnly then is a \nstreak partner\n formed\nNo chat. No profile reveal.\nCopy example:\n“You’ve found a streak partner. Show up daily to unlock who they really are.”\n5. Streak Engine (Core System)\n5.1 Daily Check‑In\nOne daily action (tap + micro‑prompt)\nNo free text\nSame effort for all tiers\nPurpose:\nShow up\nNot perform\n5.2 Canonical Streak Rules (Locked)\nCase A — Both miss same day\nStreak resets immediately\nNo recovery\nNo blame\nCase B — One misses\nStreak enters \nAT RISK\n24‑hour recovery window opens\nNudges allowed\nAt 24h mark\n:\nIf missing user checks in / pays → streak continues\nIf not → streak resets to 0\nNo extended limbo beyond 24h.\n5.3 Exit Rules (Critical Fix Applied)\nAny user may leave at any time\nLeaving during active streak:\nEnds connection quietly\nNo penalty language\nNo blame surfaced\nThis preserves consent and prevents hostage dynamics.\n6. AI Mediation Layer (Where AI Actually Matters)\n6.1 AI #1 — Streak Score Engine\nInputs\n:\nCheck‑in timing consistency\nRecovery frequency\nNudge response latency\nPast streak failures\nOutput\n:\nHidden streak health score\nUsed to:\nDetect friction\nAdjust reveal pacing\nTrigger paid reveal suggestions\nScore is never shown numerically to users.\n6.2 AI #2 — Reveal Pacing & Gating\nDefault reveal timeline applies \nonly if streak score is healthy\n.\nIf friction detected:\nReveals slow down\nEmotional framing softens\nIf engagement is strong:\nReveals accelerate (within tier caps)\nAI never skips consent‑based milestones.\n6.3 AI #3 — Reveal Framing (Emotion > Data)\nRaw profile data is \nnever dumped\n.\nAI reframes factual truth into sensory, human language.\nExample:\nRaw: Mechanical Engineer, Bangalore\nFramed: “They build things that move — in a city that wakes up to filter coffee.”\nThis increases dopamine without deception.\n6.4 AI #4 — Nudge Personalization\nNudges are:\nPre‑written\nContextual\nAI‑selected (not AI‑generated free text)\nAI chooses \nwhich\n nudge, \nwhen\n, and \nwhether at all\n.\nGoal: signal care, not pressure.\n6.5 AI #5 — Trust & Safety Monitoring\nAI continuously scans for:\nFake consistency (bot‑like behavior)\nManipulation patterns\nSudden behavioral shifts\nActions:\nSilent throttling\nReveal delays\nHuman review flags\nNo public punishments.\n7. Reveal System (15‑Day Canonical Sequence)\nReveals are \nearned\n, not purchased outright.\nMax total reveals per connection = \n5 (hard cap)\n.\nSequence:\nDemographic anchors (age, city area, routine)\nExpectation alignment (profession domain, lifestyle)\nSocial reality (opt‑in cultural data)\nHumanization (voice note / candid non‑face photo)\nIdentity unlock (name, face, chat)\nPaid reveals only \naccelerate\n, never bypass.\n8. Monetization Architecture\n8.1 What Users Pay For\nTime (streak recovery)\nFlexibility (multiple connections)\nSpeed (reveal acceleration)\nControl (filters, nudges)\n8.2 What Users Never Pay For\nAnother person’s attention\nForced visibility\nMessaging rights\nThis keeps monetization ethical and symmetric.\n9. Technical Stack (Recommended)\n9.1 Frontend\nReact Native (cross‑platform)\nState‑driven UI (streak states are explicit)\n9.2 Backend\nNode.js / NestJS\nEvent‑driven architecture (streak events, nudge events)\n9.3 Database\nPostgreSQL (core relational data)\nRedis (streak timers, recovery windows)\n9.4 AI Layer\nFeature extraction services\nRule‑constrained LLM usage (no free‑text autonomy)\n9.5 Security\nEnd‑to‑end encryption for private data\nTokenized identity verification\nZero raw ID storage\n10. Known Risks & Mitigations (Final)\nRisk\n: Users feel rejected by silence\n→ \nMitigation\n: system‑state language everywhere\nRisk\n: Friction causes churn\n→ \nMitigation\n: upfront expectation‑setting\nRisk\n: AI feels manipulative\n→ \nMitigation\n: AI frames, never fabricates\n11. Final Design Conviction\nFriction is not a tax. It is the filter.\nUnora is intentionally not for everyone.\nThat is what makes it defensible.\nReference\nThis document incorporates and formalizes the concepts defined in the original Unora design notes. fileciteturn0file0\nFirst there will be profile creation, all the necessary details completely personal will also be asked. Then they need to verify legitimacy via digilocker or by providing aadhar. Later they will be allowed to choose what server they want to join eg. Looking for a partner, friend, buddy to grow with etc.. after choosing they will be let in. In here the main screen will display the cards, it will also have filters which will be constrained based on the model they are in(free, plus or pro) Based on the filter let's say 5 cards are shown up, free tier should not have the access to refresh infinite times, some for plus and infinite for pro. Later they choose to connect, if it's mutual the streak starts. The streak will have 24 recovery window for who ever is at fault. Let's say today I don't check in the streak break and then the payment thing comes. Now we need AI here to maintain a streak score and provide the reveals based on the score. Score is used to detect if the user is not maintain the streak or there's some friction going on. It reveals in the standard timeline if everything is going fine. AI will also enhance the factual data that is going to be released. It should also suggest for the paid reveals timely and accordingly. Nudges are also AI driven to make the prompts personalized. This repeats, if streak breaks they can connect with a new user, if it continues we open them to chat. Refer to the do for more details and add the final Critical Weakness fixes. \nMonetization\nCurrent Free-Tier List - Validation\n1 connect only\nScarcity is essential.

Want to nudge your partner?”\nWhat Happens When They Nudge\nPerson B receives:\n“Your partner checked in today and would like to keep the streak going.”\nNo name.\nNo accusation.\nNo urgency language.\nThis is \ncare, not pressure\n.\nWhy This Works Psychologically\nIt reframes the streak as \nshared\nIt triggers \nreciprocity\nIt avoids shame\nIt creates \njust enough\n social pull\nThis is far more effective than alarms or reminders.\nVariations of Nudges (Unlock Over Time)\nYou can evolve nudges without changing the core mechanic.\nNeutral Nudge (Default)\n“Your partner checked in today.”\nEncouragement Nudge\n“You’re one day away from your next reveal.”\nCommitment Nudge\n“They’re waiting to continue the streak with you.”\nAll pre-written.\nAll non-judgmental.\nSecond Feature: Visible Commitment Signals\nThis is subtle but powerful.\nShow effort, not emotion.\nWhen Person A checks in, Person B can later see:\n“Partner checked in 6 hours ago”\nOr “Partner has maintained every streak day so far”\nThis creates \nasymmetric motivation\n:\n“They’re showing up — I should too.”\nNo words needed.\nThird Feature: Shared Milestones (Mini-Wins)\nDon’t wait only for big reveals.\nIntroduce \nmicro-milestones\n that both see.\nExamples:\n“3 days together”\n“First recovery saved”\n“Consistency unlocked”\nThese reinforce:\n“This is something \nwe\n are doing.”\nFourth Feature: Streak Risk Visualization\nInstead of scary warnings, show \nprogress decay\n.\nExample:\nProgress bar slowly dims\nCountdown gently ticks\nCopy: “Recovery window ends in 10 hours”\nThis creates urgency \nwithout blame\n.\nRECOMMENDED REVEAL SEQUENCE (15 DAYS, LOCK THIS)\nBased on the 5 / 4 / 3 cadence and max 5 reveals:\nReveal 1 (Early – trust building)\nAge (exact)\nHeight (range)\nCity area\nPrimary hobby depth\nReveal 2 (Expectation alignment)\nProfession domain\nEducation level\nBody-type descriptor (optional opt-in)\nDaily routine type\nReveal 3 (Social reality)\nReligion (optional, opt-in)\nEthnicity (broad category, optional)\nLanguage & cultural background\nReveal 4 (Humanization)\nVoice note\nOne immutable fact they chose to share\nReveal 5 (Final – identity)\nName\nPhoto(s)\nChat unlock\nProfile\nWhat SHOULD be in the profile (final structure)\nIdentity without identity\nAge range\n (e.g., 23–27)\nCity / area\n (Bangalore, South / Central)\nAvailability level\nCalm\nRegular\nHighly consistent\nThis anchors reality without killing mystery.\nB. Hobbies as imagination anchors (very important)\nInstead of just listing hobbies, show them as \nentry points\n.\nExample:\n🏋️ Gym — \n“Consistency over intensity”\n🎨 Painting — \n“Late nights, slow strokes”\n🧘 Yoga — \n“Morning ritual”\nThese micro-descriptions do 90% of the imagination work.\nNo free text.\nPre-written options only.\nC. Personality cues (choose 3)\nUse \nbinary or tri-state selectors\n:\nIntrovert ◉ Ambivert ○ Extrovert\nPlanner ◉ Balanced ○ Spontaneous\nQuiet focus ◉ Mix ○ High energy\nThese are \nsignals\n, not labels.\nD. Intent framing (non-dating language)\nAvoid “looking for a relationship”.\nUse options like:\n“Building something slowly”\n“Exploring with intention”\n“Consistency first, see where it goes”\nThis removes stigma and pressure.\n E. One imagination prompt (critical)\nOne sentence prompt, \nselected\n, not typed:\nExamples:\n“People usually underestimate my ___”\n“I feel most myself when ___”\n“A habit I’m proud of is ___”\nThe answer is chosen from curated options.\nThis gives the brain something to \nfill in\n.\nVerbal speech\n(B) VERBAL PITCH SCRIPT (≈ 2.5–3 MINUTES)\n“Most connection platforms today are optimized for speed — not outcomes.\n They’ve made it easy to match, but hard to trust, hard to stay consistent, and hard to build anything real.”\n“The swipe model hasn’t meaningfully changed in over a decade. Faster matching didn’t fix ghosting, distraction, or burnout. It amplified them.”\n“At Unora, we started from a different insight:\n People are patient for things that don’t feel disposable.”\n“Anticipation builds attachment.\n Effort builds trust.\n Progress creates emotional investment.”\n“So we redesigned how connection begins.”\n“Unora starts anonymous. Users choose each other based on interests, habits, and how someone shows up — not appearance.\n When there’s mutual interest, they don’t chat. They build a shared streak.”\n“Each day they check in. Each missed day puts the streak at risk.\n Consistency unlocks reveals gradually — facts, traits, clarity — until the person comes into focus.”\n“Conversation opens only after something real has been built.”\n“Streaks aren’t gamification. They’re alignment.\n People don’t return to browse — they return to continue.”\n“We use AI quietly, where it matters — improving pairing quality, reveal timing, nudges, and safety — without replacing effort or intention.”\n“Our monetization is ethical and aligned.\n Money can buy flexibility, not outcomes.\n You can’t pay to skip effort.”\n“Unora isn’t faster. It’s better.\n We’re building for people tired of disposable connection — and for a post-swipe world.”\n“That’s Unora.”\nQ&A\nCORE INVESTOR QUESTIONS & ANSWER SUMMARIES\n“Do you really think people will patiently maintain a streak?”\nShort answer:\n No — most people won’t. And that’s the point.\nExpanded answer:\n We intentionally design for \nintent\n, not volume. Friction filters out low-effort users early and improves experience and retention for those who stay. Streaks already work in products like Duolingo and fitness apps; here the emotional stakes are higher because another human is involved.\nOne-liner:\n“We don’t optimise for activity — we optimise for outcome.”\n“What happens if someone breaks the streak?”\nShort answer:\n A missed day puts the streak \nat risk\n, not broken.\nExpanded answer:\n If one person misses, there’s a recovery window. If both miss, the streak resets. A reset doesn’t end the match — it triggers a mutual decision to restart or move on within a fixed time window.\nOne-liner:\n“Reset ≠ rejection. Reset creates a pause and a choice.”\n“Won’t this create frustration and churn, especially for free users?”\nShort answer:\n Only if users are left idle — which we don’t do.\nExpanded answer:\n Every reset immediately presents a clear next action: restart or move on. Free users are never stranded. There’s always forward motion, which preserves dignity and reduces churn.\nOne-liner:\n“We never leave users stuck — every state has a next step.”\n“What if one person keeps missing repeatedly?”\nShort answer:\n The system doesn’t judge — behaviour resolves it naturally.\nExpanded answer:\n Each reset triggers a mutual choice. Over repeated breaks, one user will usually opt out. We don’t force breakups or impose hard limits; human intent self-selects.\nOne-liner:\n“We let behaviour decide, not rules.”\n“How do users motivate each other without chat?”\nShort answer:\n Through bounded, non-intrusive signals — not messages.\nExpanded answer:\n We use one-tap nudges that signal presence (“I showed up”) without pressure or guilt. This preserves safety, attraction, and anonymity while enabling accountability.\nOne-liner:\n“We don’t let users chase each other — we let them signal commitment.”\n“Is nudging really enough?”\nShort answer:\n Yes — anything more becomes pressure.\nExpanded answer:\n Free-text reminders, multiple alerts, or escalation create imbalance and resentment. Nudges work because they are rare, voluntary, and respectful. The rest of the motivation comes from system design: progress visibility, shared milestones, and anticipation.\nOne-liner:\n“Bounded tools create trust; unlimited tools create pressure.”\n“Why won’t this just feel slow compared to dating apps?”\nShort answer:\n Because slowness is the feature, not the bug.\nExpanded answer:\n Existing apps optimise for speed and attention, which leads to distraction and low-value interactions. We optimise for focus and progression. Users who want instant gratification already have infinite options — we’re unlocking a different audience.\nOne-liner:\n“Instant access feels cheap; earned access feels valuable.”\n“Isn’t this just another dating app?”\nShort answer:\n No — it’s a connection platform with delayed communication.\nExpanded answer:\n Dating is an outcome, not the category. We don’t optimise for matches or chat volume; we optimise for consistency and intent. Many users form romantic connections, but that’s a result, not the hook.\nOne-liner:\n“We don’t sell matches — we sell commitment.”\n“What about women’s safety and stigma?”\nShort answer:\n Safety is embedded structurally, not marketed loudly.\nExpanded answer:\n Delayed chat, earned identity reveals, bounded actions, and mutual consent dramatically reduce harassment and pressure. This design naturally makes the platform safer and more comfortable, especially in conservative contexts — without positioning it as a ‘women-only’ product.\nOne-liner:\n“We design for safety through structure, not slogans.”\n“How does monetization fit without breaking trust?”\nShort answer:\n We monetize time and flexibility — never identity.\nExpanded answer:\n Users can pay to protect streaks, reduce waiting time, or maintain multiple connections. We never sell unilateral access to another person. All monetization preserves mutual consent.\nOne-liner:\n“We sell control over time, not control over people.”\n“Why now? What’s changed?”\nShort answer:\n People are exhausted by attention-driven apps.\nExpanded answer:\n There’s growing fatigue with distraction, endless swiping, and shallow interaction. At the same time, users are more comfortable with progress-based systems (streaks, habits) and delayed rewards. AI allows us to pace and moderate this responsibly at scale.\nOne-liner:\n“We’re building for the post-swipe, attention-fatigued user.”\n“Do you need a tech co-founder right now?”\nShort answer:\n No — not yet.\nExpanded answer:\n At this stage, the primary risk is behavioural, not technical. We’re validating the system and experience before locking execution. We’re open to the right technical partner but are being deliberate.\nOne-liner:\n“Clarity before code.”\n“Why will this retain users long-term?”\nShort answer:\n Because progress creates attachment.\nExpanded answer:\n Retention comes from visible progression, shared milestones, anticipation, and emotional investment — not infinite choice. Users don’t come back to browse; they come back to \ncontinue\n.\nOne-liner:\n“People don’t abandon things they’ve invested effort into.”\n“What if this only works for a small group?”\nShort answer:\n That’s acceptable — and intentional.\nExpanded answer:\n We don’t need everyone. A smaller, high-intent user base with strong retention and monetization is more sustainable than mass low-intent usage.\nOne-liner:\n“Depth beats breadth in connection products.”\nFINAL META-ANSWER (Use This If You’re Pressed)\n“We’re designing a system that rewards consistency, not impulsivity.\n Friction filters intent, structure creates safety, and progress builds attachment.\n If someone isn’t willing to invest effort, they self-select out — and that’s by design.”\nWhen people ask:\n“Will people patiently maintain a streak?”\nWhat they \nreally\n mean is:\n“Will this scale if friction exists?”\nAnd the truth is:\nFriction is what creates value in connection products.\nZero-friction systems produce:\nspam\nharassment\nghosting\nlow retention\nYour product \nintentionally introduces effort\n to filter behaviour.\nBehavioural Proof (This Already Works Elsewhere)\nYou are not inventing a new human behaviour. You are \ncombining proven ones\n.\n1. Streaks work (hard proof)\nDuolingo, Snapchat, GitHub, fitness apps\nPeople maintain streaks \nfor months\n without monetary reward\nWhy?\nProgress visibility\nLoss aversion\nIdentity reinforcement\nYour streak has \nhigher emotional stakes\n than learning Spanish.\nThe Drop-Off Is a Feature, Not a Bug\nHere’s how you say this to investors:\n“We expect a steep early drop-off.\n That’s how we prevent harassment, spam, and low-intent users from entering the system.”\nThis shows maturity.\nThe Core Insight That Wins the Argument\nSay this (and pause):\n“People are already patient for things they care about.\n They just aren’t patient for things that feel disposable.”\nYour app makes connection \nnon-disposable\n.\nHow You Explain This to Skeptics\nIf someone says:\n“Is nudging really enough?”\nYou answer:\n“Yes — because anything more becomes pressure, and pressure kills connection.”\nThis is a \ndesign conviction\n, not a compromise.\nIf anyone asks:\n“How do users maintain a streak?”\nYou answer:\n“By answering one daily check-in question — it’s about showing up, not proving output.”\nOne Last Framing Tip (Important)\nIf anyone challenges you with:\n“But people want things fast.”\nYou respond with:\n“People want outcomes fast — not necessarily processes. We’re optimizing for outcomes.”\nThat single line reframes the entire debate.\nInvestor-safe explanation (use this)\nIf asked:\n“Why cap Pro at 4?”\nYou answer:\n“Because beyond that, attention fragments and connection quality drops — which goes against our core thesis.”\nThat’s a strong, principled answer.\nWhy Free \nfeels\n generous (but isn’t)\nWhen you list features line-by-line, Free looks like it has:\nStreaks\nNudges\nReveals\nA chance to continue\nThat triggers the fear:\n“Why would anyone pay?”\nBut products don’t convert because of \nfeatures\n.\n They convert because of \nconstraints and friction\n.\nWhat Free users are actually constrained by (this matters)\nOnly ONE connection\nThis is the biggest monetization lever you have.\nOne mistake = back to zero\nOne mismatch = restart\nNo hedging\nNo parallelism\nThis alone creates upgrade pressure.\nNo filters = high search cost\nYou’re underestimating how painful this is.\nFree users:\nCan’t target intent\nCan’t refine preferences\nCan’t reduce mismatch\nThey’ll \nfeel\n this friction within days.\nFilters are not cosmetic — they’re \ncontrol over time and emotion\n.\nFree pays every single time they mess up\nPlus and Pro:\nHave forgiveness built-in\nFree does not\nThat’s a very real difference when streaks last 15 days.\nFree reveals are slowest\n2 reveals vs 3 vs 4\nCuriosity gap stays longer\nAnticipation stretches\nPeople don’t pay to \nsee everything\n — they pay to \nstop waiting\n.\nFree nudges are weakest at the most stressful moment\nAt-risk is the emotional peak.\nFree: 1 nudge / 24h\nPlus/Pro: faster cadence + more total nudges\nThis difference \nfeels\n big in the moment.\nWhat Free DOES NOT get (and this is key)\nFree users do \nnot\n get:\nControl\nOptionality\nForgiveness\nSpeed\nParallelism\nPrecision\nThey get \none honest shot\n.\nThat’s not generous — that’s \nfair\n.\nA powerful way to think about it\nFree lets you try the philosophy.\nPaid lets you practice it comfortably.\nThat’s exactly how Duolingo, Notion, and Figma work.\nWhy you SHOULD be generous early\nThis is important.\nYour app asks users to:\nBe patient\nBe consistent\nResist dopamine\nTrust the system\nYou \ncannot\n then be stingy or punitive in Free.\nGenerosity builds:\nTrust\nSafety\nWord-of-mouth\nCultural legitimacy\nMonetization comes from \ndesire\n, not deprivation.\nWhy this pricing is right (very important)\nThis is NOT a volume swipe app\nYou are not competing with:\nTinder ₹99 promos\nBumble ₹199 “boosts”\nYou are competing with:\nAttention\nTime\nEmotional effort\nYour users are paying for:\nFewer connections\nHigher signal\nLower emotional cost\nThat supports higher ARPU with lower MAU.\nIndian psychology sweet spot\nIn India:\n₹99 feels disposable → attracts unserious users\n₹199 feels considered but affordable\n₹399 feels premium but not elite\nYour product needs friction to filter intent.\nPricing is part of that filter.\nWhy NOT higher (₹699 / ₹999)?\nBecause:\nYou’re early\nYou’re behavior-changing\nYou want trust before extraction\nYou can always:\nIncrease later\nIntroduce add-ons\nIntroduce limited-time premium features\nEarly pricing should invite seriousness, not exclusivity.\nInvestor justification (say this verbatim)\n“We price to filter intent, not maximize short-term revenue.\n Our users invest time first, money second.\n That creates higher retention and lower churn.”\nThat’s a \nstrong\n answer.\nInvestor justification (use this)\n“We don’t refund effort-based actions, but we also don’t punish good faith.\n Credits keep trust high without undermining commitment.”\nThis shows maturity.\nWhy 24 hours is the right window\nShort enough to prevent exploitation\nLong enough for emotional cooling\nClear and objective\nEasy to implement technically
