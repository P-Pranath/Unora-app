How to Run the Personality Service
1. Open Terminal in the project folder
cd c:\Unora\AI\personality-service
2. Start the server
cmd /c "npm run dev"
3. Open the Test UI
Open this file in your browser:

c:\Unora\AI\personality-service\test-ui.html
That's it! The server runs at http://localhost:3000 and the test UI lets you click through questions and see your personality summary.

Note: Make sure your 
.env
 file has a valid OPENAI_API_KEY for the summary generation to work.
